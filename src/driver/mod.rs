//! The multi-DB port, **frozen** in Phase 1 (#11) now that three real impls
//! justify the abstraction (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL): `connect` / `query` /
//! `introspect` / `backend` / `capabilities`. The write path (`execute`) and
//! streaming (`query_stream`) are deliberately *not* on the port — `execute`'s
//! shape depends on the changeset model designed with the gated write/diff path
//! (#64), and streaming has no Phase-1 consumer (the browse paginates). Adding
//! either now would be a speculative, untestable stub (YAGNI). They join the
//! port with their phase.
